# Countdown Timer
Simple countdown timer originally built for World Cup 2018.

Made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Customize:
Replace date in two variables:
```js
var countdownDate = new Date("June 14, 2018 11:00:00").getTime();
```
```js
var deadline = new Date("June 14, 2018 11:00:00").getTime();
```
